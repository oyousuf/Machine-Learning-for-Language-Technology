    "Analysis: “Fullyrealized” and “notverygood” are weighted highly in terms of positive reviews. The dash between these words were cut in preprocessing. Notverygood is perhaps the weirdest occurrence of the model over learning on a specific instance of a word. However, there are some words that occur more than once that have possible positive connotations, like “blast”, ”dialogues”, “rationale”, and “atmospheric” when it comes to describing movies positively. When it comes to words that weigh highly for determining a negative review, trace occurs 1021 times and has a high weight, but it isn’t a word that is obviously negative. Something similar could be said about slightest, which occurs 1022 times and has the highest weight of all, but again does not have a necessarily negative or positive connotation in everyday speech.\n",

    "I think I got 99% accuracy because when I originally tested my fit method with 1000 iterations/epochs I would get down to a TINY loss (~0.04). In terms of what a good result is, if I had to give a concrete and direct number I'd say above 80% is good. However, even though I got 99% I don't think my model is perfect (far, far from it), because this isn't optimized code and my first attempt in doing this kind of experiment. Regarding my default learning rate and lambda, the reuslts of my fit indicate that a lot of loss can be quickly removed by shrinking weights, but getting better accuracy is slower. And because lambda says how much you want to punish weights that have a large magnitude (how much large weights add to the loss), I think its default set value is okay for this model/experiment."

There were a lot of times when I'd spend hours and hours just debugging without realizing the root of my problems was that the shape of the variable being passed it, or the variable I have to include in a dot product wasn't the right shape. The hardest methods for me to make were the fit and gradient descent. The fit was hard because I had trouble figuring out what the flow was for calling other methos for updating loss and weight. I also had to rethink how to write the other methods multiple times, because even if I was determined to do it the way I originally thought of, I had to abandon a lot of ideas to make it actually work in the first place. Overall, this was really educational because I would've never done this without sklearn, but now I think I know how to implement a very inefficient and non-optimal version of sklearn.\n",
